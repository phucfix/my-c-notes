# my-c-notes

This repository contains the book **C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Ed)**
by K. N. King in markdown format.

While I was looking for C reference materials, I found it very difficult because
the sources were not detailed enough. I created this repository to look up C
syntax usage and my codes. The code is an essence of Chapters 1-15 from the book
**C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Ed (C89, C99) by K. N. King.**
